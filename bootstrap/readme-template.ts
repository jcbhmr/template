/**
 * üìñ Readme template
 *
 * There are seven major reasons that a person is looking at your readme. You want
 * to make sure that you address each one in some fashion (even if only briefly).
 * 1. They want to use it
 * 2. They want to use it IN DETAIL
 * 2. They want to know how it works
 * 4. They want to modify it
 * 5. They want to contribute modifications
 * 6. They want a feature
 * 7. They found a bug
 *
 * To satisfy all of these use-cases, a good readme should...
 * - Tell you WHAT you are looking at
 * - Provide a general overiew of how to use it
 * - Link to detailed install/beginner instructions (Wiki)
 * - Point you to more extensive user docs about it (Wiki)
 * - Explain how to run the dev scripts & what they do (code)
 * - Link to a description of how the app is designed (code)
 * - Point to a contributing guide
 * - Mention the Issues tab for features and bugs
 *
 * Read more about Wiki vs in-source-tree docs in the readme
